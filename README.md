                                "Enter Sandman"  
                                
                                Say your prayers, little one  
                                Don't forget, my son  
                                To include everyone  
                                
                                I tuck you in, warm within  
                                Keep you free from sin  
                                Till the Sandman he comes  
                                
                                Sleep with one eye open  
                                Gripping your pillow tight  
                                
                                Exit light  
                                Enter night  
                                Take my hand  
                                We're off to Never—, Neverland  
                                
                                Something's wrong, shut the light  
                                Heavy thoughts tonight  
                                And they aren't of Snow White  
                                
                                Dreams of war, dreams of liars  
                                Dreams of dragon's fire  
                                And of things that will bite  
                                
                                Sleep with one eye open  
                                Gripping your pillow tight  
                                
                                Exit light  
                                Enter night  
                                Take my hand  
                                We're off to Never—, Neverland  
                                
                                Now I lay me down to sleep  
                                Pray the Lord my soul to keep  
                                If I die before I wake  
                                Pray the Lord my soul to take  
                                
                                Hush little baby, don't say a word  
                                And never mind that noise you heard  
                                It's just the beasts under your bed  
                                In your closet, in your head  
                                
                                Exit light  
                                Enter night  
                                Grain of sand  
                                
                                Exit light  
                                Enter night  
                                Take my hand  
                                We're off to Never—, Neverland  
                                
                                We're off to Never—, Neverland  
                                Take my hand  
                                We're off to Never—, Neverland  
                                Take my hand
